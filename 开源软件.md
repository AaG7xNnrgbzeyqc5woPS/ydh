 ## QCad

QCad – computer aided drafting software

QCad is an application for 2D computer aided drafting.

QCad enables users to create technical drawings such as plans for buildings, interiors, mechanical parts or schemas and diagrams.

It uses DXF as its standard file format. While other CAD packages are often complicated to use, QCad tries to be different.

Features include:

    Layer and Block support.
    35 CAD fonts included which are extendable through .cxf files.
    24 line widths, 19 line styles, undo/redo.
    Multi-document interface.
    Unlimited undo / redo.
    Over 40 construction tools.
    Over 20 modification tools.
    Construction and modification of points, lines, arcs, circles, ellipses, splines, polylines, texts, dimensions, hatches, fills, raster images.
    Various powerful entity selection tools.
    Metric and imperial units:
        Metrical: Nanometer, Millimeter, Centimeter, Decimeter, Meter, …
        Imperial: Inch, Foot, Mile, Microinch, Mil, Yard.
        Other: Angstrom, Micron, Astro, Lightyear, Parsec.
    Support for DXF R12 and DXF 200x, BMP, JPEG, PNG.
    Part library (over 4,800 CAD parts including mechanical, electrical and processing symbols all in DXF format).
    ECMA Scripting interface:
        Creation and modification of entities.
        Create new, interactive CAD tools to integrate into QCAD.
        Create command line or GUI tools based on QCAD technology.
        Script shell.
        Almost the entire Qt API is available including:
            SQL database connectivity.
            networking.
            WebKit.
            Multimedia.
            XML.
            user interface (Widgets).
    User interface translations to a large number of languages including Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Russian, Turkish and Welsh.

## FreeCAD – parametric 3D modeler
The FreeCAD application is an open source 3D-Solid and general purpose design CAD/CAE.

FreeCAD is aimed directly at mechanical engineering and product design but also fits in a wider range of uses around engineering, such as architecture or other engineering specialities.

FreeCAD has tools similar to those offered by Catia, SolidWorks or Solid Edge.

The software makes extensive use of open source libraries include OpenCascade, Coin3D, Qt, and Python.

Features include:

    GUI application with 3D viewer.
    Command line version with low memory footprint usable as server.
    Macro recording.
    Workbenches.
    Modeling features:
        Offset (trivial or after Jung/Shin/Choi).
        Boolean operations (add, cut, intersect).
        Primitive creation.
    Creation of primitives:
        Parametric creation of box, sphere and cone.
        Topologic creation of vertex, edges, wires and planes.
        Modeling with extrudes and fillets.
    Meshes.
    Boolean operations like:
        Union – fuse shapes together.
        Difference – substraction of two shapes.
        Intersection – cut out the common parts of two shapes.
    Import: ASCII or binary STL (Stereo lithography format), OBJ format, Limited NASTRAN support, Open Inventor meshes, FreeCAD mesh kernel native.
    Export: ASCII or binary STL (Stereo lithography format), OBJ format, Limited NASTRAN support, VRML meshes, FreeCAD mesh kernel native, Mesh as Python module.
    Evaluation and Repair:
        Tests solid.
        Tests non-two-manifolds.
        Tests self intersections.
        Hole filling.
        Uniform orientation.
    Raytracing.
    Run as a Python module.
    Plugin/Module framework for late loading of features/data-types.
    Built in scripting.
